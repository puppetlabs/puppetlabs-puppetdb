    file { "$routes_file":

    }

    # TODO: we also need to make some small changes to puppet.conf, but
    #  that requires the ability to manipulate an .ini file, which
    #  we can't easily accomplish at this point.  This exec is here
    #  to notify the users of the situation.  Can't use a real 'notify'
    #  because we only want this to appear on refresh.

        Almost there!  To finish, you'll need to add the following lines to
        your puppet.conf file, in the [main] section:

            server=${settings::certname}
            storeconfigs=true
            storeconfigs_backend=puppetdb

        Then you should be able to run 'puppet agent --test' to exercise
        your puppetdb installation.
