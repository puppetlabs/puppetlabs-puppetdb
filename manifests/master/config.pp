  # **WARNING**: Ugly hack to work around a yum bug with metadata parsing. This
  # should not be copied, replicated or even looked at. In short, never rename
  # your packages...
  #
  # With `yum` we can't have the termini package override the terminus package
  # because that would prevent users from installing v2.3 of the terminus in
  # PC1. We tried using a dummy terminus-3 metadata package which pulled in
  # termini-3.latest as a dependency and put a requires terminus >= 3, <4. The
  # idea was that doing `yum install puppetdb-termini-3.x.y-1.el7` would pull up
  # the terminus package to the dummy 3 version, but `yum` has a bug which
  # requires that both the dummy package and termini be installed in the same
  # transaction, i.e. `yum install puppetdb-termini-3.x.y-1.el7
  # puppetdb-terminus-3` which is impossible to do via Puppet.
  #
  # This will orphan some old terminus files (from pre-puppet-agent, i.e. puppet
  # 3.x) that are orphaned as part of the Puppet 3 to Puppet 4 upgrade anyways
  # and some of the new terminus files temporarily. If this exec fails all you
  # need to do is reinstall whatever 2.3 version of the terminus was already
  # installed to revert the change.
