## puppetlabs-puppetdb changelog

Release notes for the puppetlabs-puppetdb module.

------------------------------------------

#### 1.4.0 - 2013/05/13

This feature release provides support for managing the puppetdb report
processor on your master.

To enable the report processor, you can do something like this:

    class { 'puppetdb::master::config':
        manage_report_processor => true,
        enable_reports => true
    }

This will add the 'puppetdb' report processor to the list of `reports`
inside your master's `puppet.conf` file.

------------------------------------------

#### 1.3.0 - 2013/05/13

This feature release provides us with a few new features for the PuppetDB
module.

You can now disable SSL when using the `puppetdb` class by using the new
parameter `disable_ssl`:

    class { 'puppetdb':
      disable_ssl => true,
    }

This will remove the SSL settings from your `jetty.ini` configuration file
disabling any SSL communication. This is useful when you want to offload SSL
to another web server, such as Apache or Nginx.

We have now added an option `java_args` for passing in Java options to
PuppetDB. The format is a hash that is passed in when declaring the use of the
`puppetdb` class:

    class { 'puppetdb':
      java_args => {
        '-Xmx' => '512m',
        '-Xms' => '256m',
      }
    }

Also, the default `report-ttl` was set to `14d` in PuppetDB to align it with an
upcoming PE release, so we've also reflected that default here now.

And finally we've fixed the issue whereby the options `report_ttl`, `node_ttl`,
`node_purge_ttl` and `gc_interval` were not making the correct changes. On top
of that you can now set these values to zero in the module, and the correct
time modifier (`s`, `m`, `h` etc.) will automatically get applied for you.

Behind the scenes we've also added system and unit testing, which was
previously non-existent. This should help us reduce regression going forward.

Thanks to all the contributing developers in the list below that made this
release possible :-).

#### Changes

* Allows for 0 _ttl's without time signifier and enables tests (Garrett Honeycutt)
* Add option to disable SSL in Jetty, including tests and documentation (Christian Berg)
* Cleaned up ghoneycutt's code a tad (Ken Barber)
* the new settings report_ttl, node_ttl and node_purge_ttl were added but they are not working, this fixes it (fsalum)
* Also fix gc_interval (Ken Barber)
* Support for remote puppetdb (Filip Hrbek)
* Added support for Java VM options (Karel Brezina)
* Add initial rspec-system tests and scaffolding (Ken Barber)

------------------------------------------

#### 1.2.1 - 2013/04/08

This is a minor bugfix that solves the PuppetDB startup exception:

    java.lang.AssertionError: Assert failed: (string? s)

This was due to the default `node-ttl` and `node-purge-ttl` settings not having a time suffix by default. These settings required 's', 'm', 'd' etc. to be suffixed, even if they are zero.

#### Changes

* (Ken Barber) Add 's' suffix to period settings to avoid exceptions in PuppetDB

------------------------------------------

#### 1.2.0 - 2013/04/05

This release is primarily about providing full configuration file support in the module for PuppetDB 1.2.0. (The alignment of version is a coincidence I assure you :-).

This feature release adds the following new configuration parameters to the main `puppetdb` class:

* node_ttl
* node_purge_ttl (available in >=1.2.0)
* report_ttl

Consult the README for futher details about these new configurable items.
